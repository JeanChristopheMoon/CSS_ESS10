Objective

The main objective is to predict voting preferences for radical right parties in Europe using Machine Learning Algorithms in Computational Social Science.

Data

The data is sourced from the European Social Survey (ESS), which is publicly available.

First Analysis

In the file named RandomForest, I attempted to predict votes for radical right parties solely based on participants' political trust.

Results

The F1 and recall scores were around 0.58 percent, with the most crucial criterion being "Trust in the European Parliament."
